Are you new to refugee resettlement? Looking to learn new skills or supervising others?

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.760
The Cultural Orientation Resource Exchange is here for you.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.220
CORE connects and supports resettlement staff, community partners and sponsors

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.800
to deliver effective cultural orientation to refugees coming to the United States.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.920
From predeparture to arrival, refugees have a lot of information

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.460
to learn and navigate. In response, CORE provides resettlement staff with

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.980
teaching tips, course materials and trainings. And for refugees and other

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.680
newcomers, CORE delivers reliable translated resources on getting started

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.900
in America. All of this is with one goal in mind:

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.620
Providing newcomers with the tools they need to navigate their new communities.
